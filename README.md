# Conclusion

1.	Work interference has the largest contribution.

2.	 Whether the employee's mental health issues interfering with the work is the thing that the company should ask for its employees. 


3.	Family history and care options(programs and benfits) provided by company is also influential in employees who want to get treatment.

4.	For all the remaining features,there has been a little contribution. noticing/knowing some of these features beforehand can even help support an individual who may be experiencing a mental health issues and and connect them with the appropriate employee resources.
